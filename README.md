### A mobile application created using  `Expo`, `React Native`, `TypeScript`

`react-native-navigation`

### Shopping cart. 
If we don't have any product in cart, 
on screen you can see empty component with button wich return 
user on to product screen. 

User can increase and decrease number of shoes or delete it from cart.
Implemented logic:
If total price > 200 delivery - 0$ if not - 15$.

### Track Order
After we create order user can check this order to "Track Order screen",
user can write reference in input and BE return this order.

BE return reference after success order
